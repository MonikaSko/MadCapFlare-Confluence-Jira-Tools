**CONS**
* online video tutorial can be too chaotic  and the guy shows examples a bit too fast for my liking [Check this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7I9-xErWOo&t=69s&ab_channel=MadCapSoftware).
* screenshots are too small and user cannot see what is written on them  
* no other languages than English available
